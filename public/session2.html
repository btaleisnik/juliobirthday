                <p style="overflow-y: scroll;">Dad, you have always been, and always will be, the best role model a son, husband, father and physician can have. I frequently remember the comments I received from leading hand surgeons in the country while interviewing for my fellowship-- they told me that you are THEIR role model too, and that you are the only one to have reached the pinnacle of hand surgery while also sustaining a great marriage and having a close and loving family. You are truly the most amazing man I have ever known. I'm so lucky to be your son, and to work with you and learn from you on a daily basis. You're so accomplished, yet also so giving and selfless. I love you, and I'm always proud to call you my dad. Happy 80th birthday!<br><br>
                Love, <br>Andres</p>

I will always remember one of our first encounters when Andres and I were dating, probably no more than a month. We were at dinner and you asked, "So, when are you and Andres going to get married?" I really didn't know how to reply other than to say, "I think you need to ask your son!" I LOVE you and Chela beyond words. It's been amazing to share my adult life with you and also for you to be such an important role model to my children. You have the respect, love, and admiration of EVERYONE who has ever met you. You are an amazing person and I am glad that you've been so involved in our life, from the very beginning. I love you with all my heart! Here's to many more happy and healthy celebrations! <br><br>XOXO~Gail</p>

                <p style="overflow-y: scroll;">Dear Dad,<br>
                It is so incredible to think that this is your 80th birthday, mostly because that means I'm not getting any younger either! This occasion has me remembering my earliest memories of you in childhood, and what really stands out are those drives we used to take together as a family in the old wood-paneled Mercury station wagon.  I can't remember where we were going or why, but I remember how you raced the car into the carport without even holding the steering wheel, and all of us children in the backseat would squeal with joy like we were at the amusement park. In those moments, you were "Super-Dad." Of course there are so many other memories, but this is a card and not a novel! I am just so happy that you are creating amazing new memories with me and John and your grandchildren here in Orange County. Happy 80th Birthday Dad, and thank you for all that you have done and all that you have shared.  You have always been, and will always be my Super-Dad. <br><br>I love you very much,
                <br>Denise</p>

                <p style="overflow-y: scroll;">Julio,<br> Congratulations and some very big hugs and kisses on reaching what is a huge milestone – your 80th birthday. <br><br>

                It’s often said that you don’t marry your wife with the thought of your father and mother in-law in mind. In my case I landed the ultimate double package. A beautiful and quite wonderful wife but also the best father-in-law anyone could wish for. I remember asking your permission to marry Denise all those years ago when we were together in Madrid. Little did I know how lucky I would be in so many ways. It’s your day today and I’ll be raising more than one glass to celebrate all that you have achieved and done. At the same time, I don’t want to forget what Chela has done to make things what they are – harmony, perfection and just all round goodness.<br><br>

                Not only do you get to enjoy a wonderful day but you also get to savor the entire year! Sit back and bask in the glow of a life full of success, achievements and happiness - all well-earned.<br><br>

                Lots of love,<br>John

                <h3>Martin Taleisnik</h3>
                <p style="overflow-y: scroll;">Happy 80th Birthday, Dad!<br><br>

                I love you most for, well, being you. Ever since I knew what a role model was, you became mine. <br><br>

                Throughout the years, I could always count on your love, support, advice, and guidance to see me through whatever part of my life I was in. One of the most important things you told me growing up was how important it was to be 51% head and 49% heart. I have seen how you practice that throughout the different aspects of your life and I try to do the same.  I think about that often and it has helped me many times over. <br><br>

                For me, you were/are the ideal of what a father should be. Everyday, I try to be the best father I can be with you as my model and goal. Indirectly, you have shaped what I have now - a wonderful wife, amazing daughters and, most important, a family that means more to me than anything else. <br><br>

                I love you and wish you the best on this very special day. I'm so glad I could spend it with you. <br><br>

                P.S. I can tell, without looking, that if my cell phone rings at around 12:30, it's you. I like that. <br><br>

                Love, Martin

                There are many things I love about you but here are my top 5<br>

                4. You are hysterically funny<br>
                3. You give us your advice and opinion but only if we ask for it<br>

                1. You adore your family and we adore you<br><br>
