                <p>Dad, you have always been, and always will be, the best role model a son, husband, father and physician can have. I frequently remember the comments I received from leading hand surgeons in the country while interviewing for my fellowship-- they told me that you are THEIR role model too, and that you are the only one to have reached the pinnacle of hand surgery while also sustaining a great marriage and having a close and loving family. You are truly the most amazing man I have ever known. I'm so lucky to be your son, and to work with you and learn from you on a daily basis. You're so accomplished, yet also so giving and selfless. I love you, and I'm always proud to call you my dad. Happy 80th birthday!</p>

                <p style="overflow-y: scroll;">Julio--I am SOOOO  proud to be a member of the Taleisnik family and I'm honored that I have THREE boys to carry on the prestigious name in the years to come. I will always remember one of our first encounters when Andres and I were dating, probably no more than a month. We were at dinner and you asked, "So, when are you and Andres going to get married?" I really didn't know how to reply other than to say, "I think you need to ask your son!" I LOVE you and Chela beyond words. It's been amazing to share my adult life with you and also for you to be such an important role model to my children. You have the respect, love, and admiration of EVERYONE who has ever met you. You are an amazing person and I am glad that you've been so involved in our life, from the very beginning. I love you with all my heart! Here's to many more happy and healthy celebrations! XOXO~Gail</p>

                <p>Salman, I remember the conversation we had as I freaked out about not understanding the course material. You were so understanding and supportive, and it really meant a lot that you listened, even to the things I wasn't saying. You have a great way with people, and that's why they gravitate towards you. Wishing you the very best at your wedding, and I hope to cross paths with you again soon :) </p>

                <p>Hey Salman, Thanks for everything that you’ve done for us in the past four weeks! You are an amazing teacher that makes learning fun. I’ve enjoyed every minute of class (including all the cat videos we watched as well..). You’ve helped me learn so much and deepened my interest in coding. Wish you all the best with your upcoming wedding and all that future has await for you!</p>

                <p>Thank you so much Salman for being such an awesome teacher and making this such a fun experience. I came into this program not knowing a thing about coding and although I do not necessary want to become a professional coder when I grow up, I now understand the power that coders have that you talk about in almost every lecture. I definitely do feel extremely powerful with all the skills and tools that you have taught us. Thanks again for everything and keep the love for fries alive :) #flawless #wokeuplikedis </p>

                <p>Salman, thank you for being an outstanding instructor, mentor, and friend. Your class has been one of the funnest learning experiences I've had and inspires me to continue learning how to code well after iX. Learning how to dance Bhangra and killing it on the dance floor at Stones with you will always be highlights of my summer here in Cape Town. Lastly, learning about the Muslim religion and pushing myself to fast with you and understanding its purpose piques my interest in a culture I want to learn more about. Basically, you've taught me a lot. <br>Rest assured that whenever I come across an epic cat meme I'll send it your way. Hopefully we'll cross paths again in the U.S. and I wish you and Nida all the best! </p>

                <p>Salman, you flew 7,888 miles from the US to Cape Town and left your fiancee for 2 months just to teach a bunch of 20-somethings how to turn ideas into reality through programming. An outsider might think you're insane but I think you're awesome. Thanks for everything!</p>

                <p>Salman - you're definitely a huge reason this program is as amazing as it is! Nothing can compare to your obsession with cats, LOL-ing at the internetsss, Stones dancing, and embarrassing youtube videos. Thanks for being a spectacular lecturer, especially since we had over 30 in a row. I can't believe how much I learned in such a short amount of time. Good luck with the wedding and move to SanFran, and I hope we all keep in touch!</p>

                <p>First of all, you are the funniest professor I've had! You always have interesting stories and good answers for everything, which made classes more interesting. I feel very lucky to have had you as my professor because you are very knowledgeable and talented. You have inspired me to "create life" and to be the best programmer I can be. <br>I hope we keep in touch and that in the future I will have the opportunity to help and inspire others as much as you have done for me!<br>If you ever visit Costa Rica, please do not hesitate to contact me!<br>I wish you and your fiancée very long, happy and healthy lives :)</p>
