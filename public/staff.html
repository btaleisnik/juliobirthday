                <p>To Julio with love,
                Memories:  The “Munch” group 1992 trip to Argentina guided by Julio was a remarkable solid beginning for building our friendship. It continues to grow over the years. We share joys of our families.
                We share food and vacations and more eating and conversation.   We share names of good books to read and great films to view.   We share life and love.

                <p>What can you say about a man who has received so many accolades during his professional life, not too much.  But I can attest to his friendship with our family in the last 50 years.  Yes, during our life time Julio has been the 'rock' that steadied our family through life-altering tragedies.  We could always count on his words of encouragement and medical expertise.  Julio and Chela have been a very special kind of friend to our family and especially to me.  Julio, we love you.

                I feel honored sharing this very special day with you, your family, and your friends.  So much has happened since an afternoon in Buenos Aires when I met you, Chela and your three kids who were so young then.  Now I raise my glass wishing for many more happy occasions as this one.
                With love and admiration,

                <p>Dear Julio:

                Congratulations on reaching this milestone of eighty years.  This special occasion has been decades in the making.  At eighty, your reactions are a little slower; names may frequently elude you, but you can also feel full of energy and life and not at all “old”.  May you continue to love and work, the two most important things in life, according to Sigmund Freud.    At eighty, you may take a longer view of life and a lived sense of history.  You are free from the urgencies of earlier days ,free to explore whatever you wish and to reflect on the thoughts and feelings of a lifetime surrounded by loving friends and family.   Much love and happiness in the future.  Mel and Myrna

                <p>Once I named Julio Taleisnik to one of my Drs and he said” he is a leyend”<br>
                I don’t know about that. What I know is he dedicate his life to his patients that adored him, to his people, to medicine and to his friends. He made together with Chela , a beautiful family. He was always for me when I needed him. Thank you.
                I’m proud to be your friend and that you considered me to celebrate your birthday.
                Wish you a long and healthy life.

                <p>Julio, I personally want to wish you a very happy birthday. More than that I have had the great pleasure of calling you a friend, neighbor, my personal hand surgeon and fellow professional for over thirty years since we both lived on Camden Drive. You performed surgery on my hands and as a dentist, my hands were my livelihood. You are a great surgeon, a great friend, and I say without exaggeration, a great person. We lived one house apart on Camden Drive for fourteen years when we and our families got to know each other. Our friendship has not varied and never will. My very best wishes from one octogenarian to another. Welcome to the club. God bless you. Sid Field.

We have traveled together in groups of good friends and your presence always enhanced our trips.  Love your sense of humor.  You have always shown that your wife, Chela your children and grandchildren are the most important people in your life.  It is so good to be able to help you celebrate eighty years and to look forward to you having many more birthdays in the very best of health.<br>

                <br><br>
                Always sartorially splendid<br>
                With Chela so beautifully blended<br>
                A surgeon of hands<br>
                Known all through the lands<br>
                Beloved by all whom he's friended.<br>
                <br>
                He travels the great world in style<br>
                He's toured and cruised mile after mile<br>
                With grandchildren dear<br>
                He's been far and near<br>
                And perhaps even sailed on the Nile.<br>
                <br>
                To Chela his love is heart warming<br>
                To his friends he is always disarming<br>
                He collects such fine watchkas<br>
                Eschews all the chatchkas<br>
                And his desk full of pens is so charming.<br>

                So happy to celebrate with you,<br>

                <p>Dear Julio.<br>
                Being male is a matter of birth. <br>
                Being a man is a matter of age. <br>
                Being a GENTELMAN is a matter of choice. <br>
                And that's what you are. <br>
                Wishing you the very best of birthdays. <br><br>

                Xoxo. <br>
                Rina</p>
