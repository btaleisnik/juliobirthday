                <p>Happy Birthday Papa! Thank you for always being there for me and for supporting me in everything that I do. I truly cherish each visit I have with you and Chaya whether we go out to dinner or just relax at home. I can always count on you to offer a clever joke, silly smile, or an interesting piece of news whenever we are together. I hope your birthday is filled with good times and amazing memories!<br><br>

                  I am so honored to be able to celebrate this incredible day with such an incredible person. If you take any aspect of your life—whether it's as a doctor, a father, a grandfather, a husband—you're off the charts in every category. You have always been such an active and influential person in my life, and I am so thankful for that. It's fascinating to hear you reminisce on your life experiences and for me to learn about the past that has shaped you into the amazing grandfather you are today. You perfectly walk the line of being both a friend and a mentor to me: always supporting me in everything I do, while still being a source of knowledge, love, and humor. <br><br>

                  Thank you, Papa, for always inspiring me to be the best version of myself. You are one of a kind, and I love you so much. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I hope that is what you continue to receive in the years to come.<br><br>

                  Love always,<br>

                <p>Dear Papa Julio,<br>
                It is wonderful that I get to come and celebrate your birthday with you, and I'm so glad I got to go with you to Costa Rica as well; I had lots of fun! While we were there, I remember all those fun hikes and activities.  My favorite one was when we hiked on a trail and at the end there was a big waterfall. I had lots of fun and I'm sure you did too. I hope your birthday is as much fun as we had then. Thanks for being a great grandpa who does fun things with me. Happy Birthday. <br>Love,<br>
                James</p>

                  Hi Jua, <br>
                  I wanted to wish you congratulations and a very happy eightieth birthday. Together we have had so many fun times and I really appreciate everything you have done for me. Our trip to Spain stands out as probably the most memorable two weeks in my life and it means a lot that I have a Grandfather who is willing to do special things like that with me. I always look forward to our dinners together because it means I get a chance to hear some more of your fun stories. You have always been around to teach and look after me, so I am glad to have the chance to be here for you on your special day.<br>
                  ~love, Tristan
